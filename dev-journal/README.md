# Development Journal

A chronological log of the LocalPet development journey. Each entry captures decisions, discoveries, challenges, and progress.

## Purpose

- **Memory**: Remember why we made certain decisions
- **Learning**: Document what worked and what didn't
- **Storytelling**: Potential blog post material or portfolio narrative
- **Debugging**: Track when bugs were introduced
- **Reflection**: See how the project evolved over time

## Entry Format

Each journal entry should include:
- **Date**: When the work happened
- **Session Goal**: What we set out to accomplish
- **What We Built**: Concrete achievements
- **Challenges**: Problems encountered and how we solved them
- **Decisions**: Architecture or design choices made
- **Discoveries**: New learnings or insights
- **Next Steps**: What to tackle next session

## File Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md
```

Examples:
- `2026-01-15-project-setup.md`
- `2026-01-16-pet-interactions.md`
- `2026-01-20-navigation-system.md`

## Tips for Journal Entries

- Write in first person (future you will appreciate it)
- Include code snippets for key decisions
- Link to relevant commits
- Be honest about mistakes and dead ends
- Capture the "why" not just the "what"
- Keep it conversational - this is for you

## Using Journal Entries

These entries can become:
- Blog posts about the development process
- Documentation for contributors
- Material for portfolio case studies
- Answers to "tell me about a challenging project" interview questions
- A fun Easter egg in the final portfolio ("Dev Journal" section)
